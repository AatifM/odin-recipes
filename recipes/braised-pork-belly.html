    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This dish is called red-cooked pork, or hong shao rou in Mandarin. It's delicious served on steamed buns or over rice. 
    Caramelized sugar, star anise, and sherry give the braising liquid a complex flavor, and a combination of soy sauce and 
    molasses gives the finished sauce its rich, mahogany color.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Skinless pork belly (3 pounds)</li>
        <li>Canola oil (1 tbsp)</li>
        <li>White sugar (1/3 cup)</li>
        <li>White sugar (2 tbsp)</li>
        <li>Water (4 cups)</li>
        <li>Large green onions (5 cut diagonally into 2 inch pieces)</li>
        <li>Garlic cloves (8 smashed)</li>
        <li>Fino dry sherry (1/2 cup)</li>
        <li>Reduced-sodium soy sauce (1/2 cup)</li>
        <li>Dark molasses (2 tbsp)</li>
        <li>Star anise (8 whole)</li>
        <li>Cucumber (1 thinly sliced)</li>
        <li>Green onion (1 thinly sliced)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut pork into eight 2x3-inch pieces.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a 6-quart Dutch oven over high heat. In 2 batches, sear pork, fat sides first, until light golden,
        30 to 60 seconds per side. Transfer to a plate. Pour out all but 1 to 2 tablespoons of the drippings.</li>
        <li>Add 1/3 cup sugar to pot; melt, stirring if needed, over medium-high heat. Cook until a light caramel color, about 1 minute. Reduce heat to medium, then return pork to pot, turning pieces to coat. When sugar darkens to an orange color,
             after about 1 minute, add water; stir to loosen any sugar stuck to the bottom.</li>
        <li>Add green onions, garlic, sherry, soy sauce, molasses, star anise, and remaining 2 tablespoons sugar. If needed, add up to 1/2 cup additional water to nearly cover pork. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low. Simmer, covered,
             turning occasionally, until a knife inserted 1/4 inch into the fat layer meets little resistance, about 1 hour and 45 minutes.</li>
        <li>Transfer pork to a plate with a slotted spoon; loosely cover. Skim fat and drain solids from cooking liquid. Return 4 cups liquid to pot and bring to a boil; simmer over medium-high heat until reduced to about 1 cup, about 30 minutes. 
            Sauce will thicken more as it cools.</li>
        <li>Slice pork into twenty-four 1/2-inch-thick pieces. Working in batches, warm pork with half the sauce in a large nonstick skillet over medium to medium-high heat. Turn pork frequently to coat and, if desired, let sear slightly. 
            Garnish with cucumber slices and sliced green onion.</li>
    </ol>
