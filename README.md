# Odin Recipes

A simple HTML-only project created as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) course. This project serves as a basic introduction to structuring web pages using HTML.

## 📌 Project Overview
Odin Recipes is a basic webpage that showcases different recipes using fundamental HTML elements. It helps reinforce concepts such as:
- Structuring an HTML document
- Using headings, paragraphs, lists, and links
- Creating a simple navigation system

## 🚀 Features
- A homepage listing available recipes
- Individual recipe pages with ingredients and cooking instructions
- Internal linking between pages

## 📂 Project Structure
```
odin-recipes/
│── index.html  # Homepage listing all recipes
│── recipes/
│   ├── recipe1.html  # Recipe page 1
│   ├── recipe2.html  # Recipe page 2
│   ├── recipe3.html  # Recipe page 3
```

## 🔧 How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/AatifM/odin-recipes.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd odin-recipes
   ```
3. Open `index.html` in your preferred web browser.

## 📖 Learning Outcomes
Through this project, I have gained hands-on experience with:
- Writing structured and semantic HTML
- Organizing files and directories in a project
- Navigating between pages using relative links

## 📝 Future Improvements
- Add CSS for better styling
- Implement responsive design
- Include images for each recipe
